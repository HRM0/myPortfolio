                    I'm a pretty simple guy who grew up in California and moved out to NYC to join a band. After 10 years of being an accountant by day and a musician by night, 
                    I switched my focus into programming. Programming has always been an interest of mine and was something I studied in college. I have spent the last couple 
                    of years relearning the basics and putting the time in to learn full-stack web development. In July 2023, I reached a significant milestone by graduating 
                    from Fullstack Academy's full-time immersive program. I look forward to the challenges of the future and the solutions they drive me to create.
